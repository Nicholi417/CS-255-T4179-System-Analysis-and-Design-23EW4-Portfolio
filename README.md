# CS-255-T4179-System-Analysis-and-Design-23EW4-Portfolio
This is the portfolio for my CS-255-T4179 System Analysis and Design class 

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was DriverPass and they wanted to design an online learning space for getting a drivers license. They wanted online learning materials along with the ability to take tests and schedule in person driving appointments.

2. What did you do particularly well?

I figured out my mistakes and organizing information. I was tasked to make a Use Digram and version one was a mess. It was complicated and had lines going every where. After looking at others, I streamlined it and color coded it. No one I saw used colors, but after looking it would have made it a lot easier to follow with everyones. I carried those same color codes to subsequent diagrams, for the "owner" user all diagrams were a teal green color of various shades.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Of the documents submitted I would rework the System Design. I didn't go into specifics about the kind of hardware they needed or give an example, I assumed that their IT person would be able to handle that. In previous requests I have gone into deep research when no IT person was mentioned.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpretted their needs based on my own knowledge of the DMV, online schooling, and their information interview. It's their product. If you don't design something they want then you are forcing your ideas onto them. They should never be forced to accept something that is not what they want. Now, minor alterations and interpretations is fine, but a complete overhaul is terrible.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

It is similar to making anything else, I take it from general idea to specifics. I start by having a general idea in mind, a webpage with links to different areas. Next I move onto more specific stuff, what links need to be there. Lastly I move on to the most focused, what each link will look like.
